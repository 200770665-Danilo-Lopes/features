Acceptance Criteria

  Feature: Driver Matching
  
    @matching-criteria
    Scenario: Match with nearest available driver
      When the system searches for drivers
      Then it should consider the following factors:
        | distance        |
        | rating          |
        | vehicle type    |
      
      And I should be matched with a driver within 5 minutes
      And I should see the driver's details:
        | name           |
        | photo          |
        | car model      |
        | license plate  |

    @driver-acceptance
    Scenario: Driver accepts a new request
      When a nearby driver is found
      Then I should receive a notification
      And I should see the driver's current location on the map
      And I should see the estimated time of pickup

    @driver-decline
    Scenario: Driver declines a new request 
      When the matched driver declines my request
      Then the system should immediately search for another driver
      And I should be notified that a new driver is being found
      And my estimated pickup time should be updated
