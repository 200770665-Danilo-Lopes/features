## Feature: Ride Tracking

### `@live-tracking` Scenario: Track driver location in real-time
```
When I view the tracking screen
Then I should see:
  | driver's current location      |
  | my current location            |
  | destination                    |
  | optimal route                  |
  | estimated time of arrival       |
And the map should update every 3 seconds
And I should see the remaining distance
```

### `@share-trip` Scenario: Share trip details with contacts
```
When I tap "Share Trip Status"
And I select a contact from my list
Then my contact should receive a link to track my ride
And they should see my real-time location
And they should see my estimated time of arrival
```

### `@route-change` Scenario: Driver takes alternate route
```
When the driver deviates from suggested route
Then the ETA should be recalculated
And I should see the updated route on the map
And I should see the new estimated time of arrival
